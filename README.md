Simplex Optimization Algorithm and Implemetation in C++ Programming

# Introduction

The downhill simplex algorithm was invented by Nelder and Mead [1]. It is a method to find the minimum of a function in more than one independent variable. The method only requires function evaluations, no derivatives. Thus make it a compelling optimization algorithm when analytic derivative formula is difficult to write out. In this article, I will discuss the simplex algorithm, provide source code and testing code in C++, show rich examples and applications. I will basically follow the spirit of reference [1], in addition, I try to explain the algorithm in a more "example-oriented" manner.
